basic idea: the bot test every possible move against RandomBot.java and defines rules on which it will choose cards.
This will result in a much smaller workload for everyday use, because static rules are way more time efficient than
calculating every move again.
It's like creating a KV-diagram based on different inputs and outputs of a circuit system.
The KV-diagram will break down a large logic gate into more conveniet "portions" (the rules).
Basically a manual version of Machine Learning.
