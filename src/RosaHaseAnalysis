all negatives are converted to positive
n <= 5 -> return n*2 +1 or +2

n = 6 -> return 13

n = 7 -> if userCards has 14, return 7
        if userCards has 1 return 1

n = 8 -> if userCards has 15, return 8
        if userCards has 2 return 2

n = 9 -> if userCards AND not(opponentCards) has 14, return 14
        if userCards has 2, return 2

n = 10 -> if userCards AND not(opponentCards) has 15 return 15
        if userCards has 1, return 1


generalized pattern idea:
given n, userCards, opponentPattern

negative numbers are counted as n*-1

if opponentCards has n+5, return lowest card
else return n+5

always make random card + counter, if return fails
